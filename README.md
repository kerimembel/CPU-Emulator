# CPU Emulator

This project has been developed to work on the terminal. It can run the instructions that are included in it.

To be able to run, java and javac commands must be added to the system path so that they can run on the terminal.

If it is desired to run outside of the terminal, ie an IDE, the line in the Main file that takes the file name as a parameter can be changed to receive input from the IDE terminal.


For these codes to work, firstly from the terminal, java files need to be compiled with the command below;

javac * .java

Then to run, the command below must be executed.

java Main "filename"
